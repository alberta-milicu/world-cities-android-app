# CityFinder

This project consists of an Android app written in Java (containing AIDL),
a web server written in Node.js and a database created using SQL queries,
with the PostgreSQL environment.

The Web Server
The purpose of this web server is to get connected to the database, from
where data may be manipulated (the code for most of this is in app.js). On
top of that, a table.html page was also created to display a table containing
the database entries. In addition, app.js contains code that generates locally
a .json file containing all data. 

The Android app
Written using Android Studio, this app handles the data stored in the web
server and provides an interface that allows the user to view the cities
entered in the database.

The interface provides a ListView of all the cities from the web server,
which, upon clicking, open a page with details specific to the clicked
city. In a addition to that, on this page there is a drop down menu that
allows the user to choose any other city from the database, and then
compute the linear distance between the previously selected city and the
one selected from the drop down menu.

Details from the database are being manipulated after being read from a
.json file generated by the web server, using Volley.

The AIDL
This service's purpose is to compute the linear distance and then print it
on the screen.
